  	 	  	   </div>
			   <div class="plan_list">
				<p class="bold_1">1.Calorie Deficit:</p>
				Create a moderate calorie deficit to promote weight loss. Aim for a daily deficit of 500-700 calories by adjusting your calorie intake and increasing physical activity.<br>

				<p class="bold_1"> 2. Balanced Meals:</p>
					Focus on a balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-dense foods. Aim to include the following in your diet:

					- Lean Protein: Include sources such as chicken breast, turkey, fish, tofu, legumes, and low-fat dairy products.
					- Fruits and Vegetables: Incorporate a wide range of colorful fruits and vegetables to provide essential vitamins, minerals, and fiber.<br>
					- Whole Grains: Opt for whole grains like brown rice, quinoa, oats, whole wheat bread, and pasta for their higher fiber content.<br>
					- Healthy Fats: Include sources like avocados, nuts, seeds, olive oil, and fatty fish (salmon, mackerel) for their beneficial omega-3 fatty acids.<br>
					- Limit Refined Sugar and Processed Foods: Minimize your consumption of sugary snacks, sodas, desserts, processed foods, and fried items.<br>

				<p class="bold_1">3. Portion Control:</p> 
					Pay attention to portion sizes to avoid overeating. Use smaller plates and bowls to help control portion sizes and eat mindfully, focusing on hunger and fullness cues.<br>

				<p class="bold_1">4. Hydration:</p>
					Drink an adequate amount of water throughout the day. Water helps maintain hydration, supports digestion, and can help control appetite.<br>

				<p class="bold_1">5. Meal Planning:</p>
					Plan your meals in advance to ensure you have healthy options readily available. Prepare meals at home using fresh ingredients to have better control over ingredients and portion sizes.
